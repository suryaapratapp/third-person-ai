UI Enhancements (Chat Analysis UX, Paste Flow, Preflight, How-It-Works arrows, Profile fields) — UI-only

Context:
- React + Vite + Tailwind, dark GenZ-love theme.
- Keep existing routes/component names. No backend changes required for this ticket.
- Current Chat Analysis has messaging app cards (with file hints) + two buttons: “Upload Export File” and “Paste Chat Text”.
- We want to improve clarity and trust, and make Paste flow independent but still high quality.

========================================================
Ticket 1 — Messaging App Cards: remove “Paste (text)” label, keep file hints
========================================================
1) On messaging app selection cards:
   - Remove any “Paste (text)” / “Paste” labels from cards.
   - Keep ONLY file format hints per app (small, secondary text), e.g.:
     - WhatsApp: “.txt export”
     - Telegram: “.json export”
     - Instagram: “.json / export folder”
     - Messenger: “.json / export folder”
     - iMessage: “.csv / .txt transcript”
     - Snapchat: “.json export”
2) Keep the cards clickable for app selection (used for Upload flow only).
3) Visual: make file hints look like small “chips” (muted background, colorful border accent), no emojis.

========================================================
Ticket 2 — Upload vs Paste: decouple flows but keep both premium
========================================================
Goal: Upload is app-linked. Paste is universal (any app / any text) and must guide users to provide clean speaker separation.

A) Two primary buttons remain:
   - “Upload Export File”
   - “Paste Chat Text”
B) Behavior:
   - Upload Export File: requires a selected app card (whatsapp/telegram/instagram/messenger/imessage/snapchat).
     - If user clicks Upload without selecting app: show a friendly inline hint “Pick an app first so we can parse correctly.”
   - Paste Chat Text: does NOT require app selection.
     - When user enters paste mode, hide/gray out the app selection area and show “Paste works with any chat format.”

C) Paste Mode UX improvements (must)
1) Add a “Format helper” above the textarea:
   - “Works best when each message clearly includes a speaker name.”
   - Provide 2–3 short examples in a collapsible “Show example formats”:
     Example 1:
       [10/02/2026, 01:21] Mehak: hey
       [10/02/2026, 01:22] Surya: hi
     Example 2:
       Mehak: hey
       Surya: hi
     Example 3 (group):
       Ankit: …
       Mehak: …
       Surya: …
2) Add a small “Participants detected” pill section that updates live as user types:
   - Count unique speakers (best-effort heuristic: detect “Name:” prefixes, bracket formats, or “- Name:”)
   - Show: “Participants: 2 detected” or “Group chat: 4 detected”
   - If only 1 participant detected: show warning “We need at least 2 people (or distinct speaker labels) for best results.”

========================================================
Ticket 3 — Paste Mode Timeline Prompt (only if system can’t detect)
========================================================
Requirement:
- After user pastes text, if date range cannot be confidently detected, ask user for approximate timeline.

Implement:
1) After paste textarea, add a “Timeline” card that appears ONLY when:
   - text length > threshold (e.g. 200 chars) AND
   - detectedDateRange is null/unknown (use existing preflight parser logic or a simple heuristic)
2) Timeline UI:
   - A segmented control / radio chips:
     - “1–3 days”
     - “1–3 weeks”
     - “1 month”
     - “More / not sure”
   - If “More / not sure” selected, show a small optional input:
     - “Approx start date” (date picker)
     - “Approx end date” (date picker)
   - Copy: “This helps us build timelines even when timestamps are missing.”
3) Store selection in paste preflight state (UI-only), and display it in Preflight Summary “Date range”.

========================================================
Ticket 4 — Preflight Summary upgrades (both upload + paste)
========================================================
In the Preflight Summary panel, include these fields:

1) Messages detected (number)
2) Date range
   - If detected: show “Feb 10 → Feb 11 (2 days)”
   - If unknown and user selected timeline chips: show that selection
   - If still unknown: show “Unknown (we’ll do best-effort)”
3) Estimated analysis time (simple, non-promissory label)
   - e.g. “Quick”, “Medium”, “Deep”
   - based on message count buckets (no minutes/seconds promises)
4) Chat Preview (privacy-safe)
   - Add a “Safety preview” section that scans for restricted/suspicious/harmful content (UI-only heuristic is fine):
     - phone numbers, emails, addresses, explicit sexual content keywords, self-harm keywords, hate slurs list (minimal)
   - In preview rendering:
     - Replace flagged snippets with “Encrypted for your privacy”
     - Show a lock icon and label “Sensitive content hidden”
   - Add toggle “Show raw preview” (default OFF) with a warning. For launch, you can keep it disabled or require confirmation.
5) Ensure these preflight items are visible before “Run Analysis” is enabled.

========================================================
Ticket 5 — Analysis Flow section: add arrows between steps (Chat Analysis page)
========================================================
Update “ANALYSIS FLOW” section:
- Keep existing steps but add tasteful arrow connectors between them.
- Use minimal line icons (SVG or lucide) and subtle glow to match dark theme.
- Ensure responsive layout: horizontal with arrows on desktop; vertical with down-arrows on mobile.

========================================================
Ticket 6 — Landing page “HOW IT WORKS”: add arrows between steps
========================================================
- Add arrow connectors between steps that look good in dark GenZ theme.
- Use consistent arrow style with Analysis Flow section.
- Ensure mobile layout switches to vertical with down arrows.

========================================================
Ticket 7 — Profile page: add general user profile details (UI-only)
========================================================
In the Profile section/page:
1) Add editable fields:
   - Location (city/country free text + optional dropdown later)
   - Languages spoken (multi-select chips + allow custom entry)
   - Favorite food (free text)
2) Add “Save” button.
3) Persist locally for now (localStorage) under a single key `tpai_profile`:
   {
     location: string,
     languages: string[],
     favoriteFood: string
   }
4) Show success toast “Profile updated”.
5) Keep styling consistent with dark theme.

========================================================
Acceptance Criteria
========================================================
- Messaging app cards no longer show “Paste (text)”; they show only file format hints.
- Paste Chat Text works without selecting an app and guides users to provide speaker-separated text.
- Timeline chips appear only when timestamps aren’t detected and user has pasted enough text.
- Preflight Summary includes: Messages detected, Date range, Estimated analysis time label, Safety Preview with encrypted redactions.
- Analysis Flow and Landing “How It Works” show arrows between steps (desktop + mobile).
- Profile page includes Location, Languages, Favorite Food and saves locally.
- No backend changes; no broken routes; `npm run dev` succeeds.
