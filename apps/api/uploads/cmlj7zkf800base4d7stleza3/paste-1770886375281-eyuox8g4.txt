[31/01/2026, 01:07:39] Mehak Bhardwaj: Hello sir, I am confused about one thing which framework should we choose for the backend?
Even though I am currently most comfortable with Spring Boot, from what I have read, it is not always a good choice for small- to medium-sized projects.
Express is a good choice for fast startup, concurrency, and real-time I/O tasks, while FastApi is often preferred for AI/ML-heavy workloads.
So, should we stick to either Python or Node, or can we use a hybrid approach using Python for AI-related tasks and Node for handling the rest?

Or if there is any better framework?
[31/01/2026, 16:49:08] Surya: Hi mehak, you're thinking in the right direction. We should follow the hybrid approach - node for core backend logic, and fastapi for AI/LLM
[31/01/2026, 16:49:37] Surya: https://www.mosaicchats.com/chat-analysis
[31/01/2026, 16:54:55] Surya: analyse mosaic
[31/01/2026, 16:55:48] Surya: also, UI/UX as discussed on call - keep glassmorphism dark-mode theme in mind, it appeals GenZ aesthetics!
[31/01/2026, 16:57:27] Mehak Bhardwaj: Ok sir, I'll be going with dark shades then
[02/02/2026, 08:20:38] Surya: Good morning Mehak, 
Please let me know if you face any issues or have any questions!
[02/02/2026, 14:50:31] Mehak Bhardwaj: Good Afternoon sir , I have been working on frontend from past 2 days , I will try to finish it up by today or tomorrow to get a review from you ‎<This message was edited>
[02/02/2026, 15:09:06] Surya: Great work - thank you!

[03/02/2026, 21:52:11] Mehak Bhardwaj: Hello Sir, i did some experiments on frontend and created this till now , you can review it in your pc , since i have'nt added mobile responsiveness yet. I'm looking forward to know that what changes i have to make in it.
[03/02/2026, 21:56:49] Mehak Bhardwaj: I am bit confused about what details i have to add on landing page since that will decide design of our backend also
[06/02/2026, 12:43:03] Surya: I’ll update you on this!
[08/02/2026, 16:42:38] Surya: Hi Mehak,
Please research current LLMs, compare them and perform a SWOT analysis for each including pricing (token/usage costs). Identify the best value and fit for our project.
Also, review recent research on conversation analysis, sentiment analysis and personality inference from text.

Also, please share your bank/UPI details. Thank you!
[08/02/2026, 16:49:05] Surya: This looks really good. 

I’ve updated thethirdperson.ai sim - I’ll update the keywords later. 

For this week, let’s focus on documenting the complete application architecture and all required components.
[08/02/2026, 18:55:16] Mehak Bhardwaj: Ok sir
[08/02/2026, 18:56:57] Mehak Bhardwaj: I'm glad that you liked it
[08/02/2026, 19:01:41] Mehak Bhardwaj: I use this number for UPI 0987
[09/02/2026, 00:10:00] Mehak Bhardwaj: https://third.app/. -- sir i have modified the frontend and added MCQ based questionnaire to some sections
[09/02/2026, 00:11:57] Mehak Bhardwaj: For now you'll get the best view on pc since I haven't made it responsive for mobiles
[09/02/2026, 00:20:42] Mehak Bhardwaj: Do let me know if the previous one was better or if both designs are not meeting your expectations 

Since I am not very good with the frontend so if it needs more enhancement in any aspect I'll keep working on it side by side while doing the specific tasks you'll assign me
[09/02/2026, 14:42:59] Surya: Hi Mehak, we’ll talk about the product architecture tomorrow. Hold working on the product development part!

[09/02/2026, 17:02:15] Mehak Bhardwaj: I have figured out the best LLM that project should use now I just have to calculate which one has better cost to performance ratio
