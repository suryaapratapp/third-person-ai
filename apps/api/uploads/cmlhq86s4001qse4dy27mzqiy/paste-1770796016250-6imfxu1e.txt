Fix Chat Analysis “Run Analysis” flow: 401 Unauthorized and 429 spam caused by missing/expired auth token + polling not stopping.

Symptoms:
- POST /upload-sessions returns 401 Unauthorized.
- UI continues polling GET /upload-sessions/:id rapidly, triggering 429 Too Many Requests and uncaught promise errors.
- Console points to src/api/client.js and ChatAnalysisPage.jsx polling loop.

Root causes to address:
1) apiFetch is not attaching Authorization header with backend access token (token is nested under tokens.accessToken from /auth/login).
2) ChatAnalysis polling continues even after auth failure / rate limit responses.

Requirements:

A) Normalize auth session shape (single source of truth)
- Ensure authService stores session consistently as:
  { user, accessToken, refreshToken }
  derived from backend login response:
  { user, tokens: { accessToken, refreshToken } }
- Update authService.login() to map response into this normalized shape.

B) Fix apiFetch to attach access token
- In src/api/client.js:
  - Read accessToken from authService.getSession()
  - If accessToken exists, set header:
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  - Ensure it is attached for ALL protected requests, including upload-sessions endpoints.

C) Handle 401 globally and in polling
- In apiFetch:
  - If response status is 401, clear session and redirect to /auth/signin (or return a structured error so UI can redirect).
- In ChatAnalysisPage polling:
  - Stop polling immediately if response status is 401/403.
  - Stop polling and show a “Rate limited, please wait” message if status is 429.
  - Add exponential backoff polling (2s → 4s → 8s, cap 10s).
  - Ensure all polling promises are awaited/caught (no “Uncaught (in promise)”).

D) Improve UI error messaging
- Replace generic “Unauthorized/Bad Request” blocks with friendly messages:
  - 401: “Session expired. Please sign in again.”
  - 429: “Too many requests. Waiting a moment…”
- Keep existing UI layout; just improve state handling.

Acceptance criteria:
- When logged in, POST /upload-sessions succeeds (no 401).
- If token is missing/expired, user is redirected to Sign In and polling stops.
- No repeated 429 spam; polling backs off and handles errors cleanly.
- Running analysis works end-to-end after login.

Deliverables:
- Updated authService to normalize tokens.
- Updated apiFetch to attach Authorization header correctly.
- Updated ChatAnalysisPage polling to stop/backoff on 401/429 and catch errors.
